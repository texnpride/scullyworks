		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<p>I'm hosted with GitHub Pages.</p>
		<p>In my production work, I explore the sinuous lines and silvery marks of a Russian-style filigree. I learned the fabulous techniques from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/NatalieRoseCustom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natalie</a> when we were at Kent State, after she returned from a workshop taught by <a href="https://www.snagmetalsmith.org/members/victorialansford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victoria Lansford</a>.</p>
		<p>In my artwork, I conflate pop culture with social and political issues by turning innocuously beautiful jewelry into wearable subversive conversations.</p>
